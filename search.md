## Simple site search

Below you can search this site, using [Lunr.js](/without-plugin/search-lunr). This uses a local index file. Alternatively you can use the very simple [Google search box](/without-plugin/search-google){:.gray}, that uses the Google index to find its pages (which requires an [XML sitemap](/without-plugin/sitemap){:.gray} to help Google find the latest additions to your website).
