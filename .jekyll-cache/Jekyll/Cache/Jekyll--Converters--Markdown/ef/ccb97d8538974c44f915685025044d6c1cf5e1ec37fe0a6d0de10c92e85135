<p>Although the primary function of this page/form is to illustrate how the <a href="/without-plugin/form-builder" class="gray">form builder</a> and <a href="/without-plugin/better-forms" class="gray">better forms</a> work, it will actually send an email to my inbox. It uses <a href="https://formspree.io" class="gray">Formspree</a> to do so, as this website is hosted on GitHub.</p>
